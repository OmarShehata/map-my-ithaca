# Map my Ithaca

This is an art project inspired by the book [The Image of the City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City) where they asked people to draw a map of their city and compared it with the real map. The goal was to uncover the "mental map" we form in our heads of the places we live.

The goal of this project is to uncover, share & celebrate our own personal maps of where we live, specifically in Ithaca, NY.

## Example mental map

Here is an example of a map I made & a short reflection:

Here's a stripped down version with the map I drew in red, and the "correct" map highlighted in green.
